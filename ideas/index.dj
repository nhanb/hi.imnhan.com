## NAS options

### Mini/micro PC: use m.2 -> 5xSATA adapter

Already got an HP EliteDesk 800 Desktop Mini G1, which seems to have m.2 2280
pcie slot: <https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Business-PCs-Workstations-and-Point-of-Sale-Systems/HP-EliteDesk-800-G1-SSD-Compatibility/td-p/8335711>

Potential shopping list:

- <https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005003010904342.html> (has data & power wires too)
- <https://www.lazada.vn/products/525-inch-to-5-x-35-inch-sata-hdd-cage-rack-hard-drive-disk-enclosure-disk-tray-adapter-i2421205886-s11929573138.html>

### Topton N5105 build

- Case: sama im01 <https://voz.vn/t/tim-vo-case-nao-nho-gon-matx-lap-duoc-2-4-hdd-may-bac.818843/>
- Needs hdd cages
- Motherboard: [Topton N5105](https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005005398288415.html)
- PSU: TBD

### Mid-tower office PC

... is self-explanatory. Usually comes with 4-ish 3.5" brackets out of the box.

Or go SFF and still get 2 3.5" bays:

## A Linux appliance with u-root

Only the kernel and a Go runtime, plus [a bunch][1] of busybox-like utils.
Doesn't get more minimal than that!

Candidates:

- rss reader: see below
- git-in-a-box: see [go-git][5]
- btrfs NAS: encryption can use either gocryptfs, or fscrypt when its btrfs
  support lands in mainline... [apparently soon?][6]

Why not gokrazy? Nothing wrong with it, though I don't really need most of its
amenities. Also I recently tried to update my old gokrazy instance and it
failed for no obvious reason. Searching existing issues yielded no result and
I'm too lazy to investigate further.

### Preliminary research

No ufw, so learn to use nftables directly instead.
[This][2] is a good starting point.

No ca-certificates: [copy from host][3] instead, e.g. on Arch:

```
u-root -files '/etc/ca-certificates/extracted/tls-ca-bundle.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'
```

To draw to fbdev, see [cmds/exp/fbsplash][4]. Helpful to draw a dashboard to
hdmi out, like gokrazy.

TODO: check if tailscale can run on this. That would cleanly solve the "enter
disk encryption passphrase remotely after reboot" problem.

## Self hosted RSS reader in pure Go

- Single executable, web based
- bbolt for persistence
- Bonus: e-ink friendly display
- Bonus: netsurf friendly

## Desktop GUI blogging CMS using Tcl/Tk + Go backend

- Native win/mac look-and-feel, acceptable on linux (`clam` looks alright)
- SQLite as application file format
- WYSIWYG Ã  la ProseMirror, exportable to djot/markdown.
- Sane embedded image/video/etc. file management via GUI

  + Bonus: 1-click preprocessing: strip EXIF, losslessly optimize image

- *No embedded browser*
- Is static site generator, but supports 1-click deployment to neocities,
  github/gitlab/sourcehut pages etc.
- Human-friendly distribution.
  Ideally only two binaries: main proram and tclsh/wish executable.
- Bonus: pluggable templates

## Discord bot that launches CSGO/etc. server on demand

Eyeing Linode's 4GB RAM tier at $0.03/hr. But in general it should work on any
cloud VPS that supports (almost) instant VM launch via API, and snapshots.

- Easy on/off/status commands via Discord bot maybe
