<h1>&#34;Have you built anything cool?&#34;</h1>

<p>So recently I went to a <em>networking event</em>—something I have never liked or been good at. I’m
not sure if I’m one of those introverts or if I’m just socially awkward, but the very idea of
going around trying to converse with total strangers just to exchange business cards is not at all
appealing to me. Anyway, that’s another story. Right now I want to write about something a guy
from a non-tech company asked me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Have you built anything cool?<br>
- [pause] Well, more or less…<br>
- What do you mean by “more or less”? […] Have you built anything at all?<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I went on trying to explain what my recent side
project—<a href="https://pytaku-legacy.appspot.com">pytaku</a>—does and why it is
awesome for me. He seemed to be disinterested halfway through so I decided to shut up anyway.</p>
<p>Sure, I have done stuff now and then, be it assignment work or something I decided to create
for my own amusement. It is just funny how I have already stepped into to my final year without
taking a proper look back at what I have done in these past 2 years, so I’m going to do just that.</p>
<p>If you—Nicholas—are reading this and don’t want all the nerdy stuff, here are my condensed
answers:</p>
<section id="Have-you-built-anything">
<h3>Have you built anything?</h3>
<p>Yes, I have made desktop and Android games, a movie ticket sales program, a desktop manga
grabber, a web version of it that talks to dropbox, and several small shell scripts / web
utilities.</p>
</section>
<section id="So-nothing-cool">
<h3>So, nothing cool?</h3>
<p>If you’re neither a tech geek nor an otaku (which I assume you’re not) then no, there’s probably
nothing I’ve done that you would find interesting.</p>

<section id="Nerd-alert">
<h2>Nerd alert!</h2>
<p>The rest of this post is aimed at the <del>nerdier</del> more tech-savvy audience. You have been
warned ;)</p>

<section id="First-year-Welcome-to-the-web-and-the-GUI-programming-disillusionment">
<h2>First year: Welcome to the web, and the GUI programming disillusionment</h2>
<p>I had touched <em>web stuff</em> before in high school: a vBulletin forum that I created (unofficially)
for students in my middle school. However, I only properly learned PHP and JS when I started the
Web Programming course here. With (moderately) great power came great desires, so I set out to
build a basic PHP site to scrape a youtube view page’s HTML to get direct video links (not working
anymore since a recent youtube update):</p>
<p><img alt="tubegrab v2.9" src="tubegrab.jpg"></p>
<p>That was my first touch on jQueryUI and regular expressions; I also learned how RMIT’s mekong
server sucked to the point that it didn’t allow <code>get_file_contents()</code>.</p>
<p>About school assignments? Nothing interesting: standard minimal LAMP CMS with jQuery glitter
sprinkled on top. Not a bad experience but meh.</p>
<p>I also learned about MVC and GUI programming with Java swing. I did write a movie ticket program
with a (pretty minimal) seat picker and
<a href="https://github.com/nhanb/sealord">a battleship-inspired game</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Cinema Movie Picker" src="cinema_1.png">
<img alt="Seat Picker" src="cinema_2.png">
<img alt="Sealord" src="sealord.png"></p>
<p>Then it occurred to me that programming GUI interfaces for desktop programs was much more tedious
than doing it for the web, especially when working with the now-not-favored Swing toolkit.
Nightmarish days…</p>
<p>Another lesson learned the hard way was that “MVC” is not even a concrete thing, and there is
hardly any obvious “one true way” to implement that. I spent much more time planning for plumbing
code than I the time I spent actually writing “feature” code. And the result, now looking back, was
not even that good. And yeah, there was no such thing as “separation of concerns” in my code back
then, which eventually led to countless times of tracing obscure stack traces for debugging (good
thing I had a lot of free time back then).</p>
<p>To rub salt in the wound, I came to realize that nobody cared how Swing looked on any desktop
environment other than OS X and Windows. Font rendering was painful to look at, and the only way to
make it <em>a little bit</em> more acceptable was using a
<a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/install-openjdk-patched-with-font-fixes.html">forked version of OpenJDK</a>.
WTF guys? And that’s not the only problem; let’s talk Look And Feel. Java’s built-in
getSystemLookAndFeel() could only detect GNOME’s. When developing <code>ajmg</code> I discovered that and had
to write my own method that extended the thing to detect more DEs, but soon after that I thought
“What the hell, why do I even have to do this?” and decided that Swing was dead to me (or any
desktop Linux user for that matter).</p>

<section id="Second-year-enough-of-this-bull-school-crap-I-m-making-stuff-for-myself">
<h2>Second year: enough of this <del>bull</del> school crap. I’m making stuff for myself!</h2>
<p>To be fair, the following year has offered a number of new stuff: C/C++ programming, a taste of the
M$ .NET C# stack (still impressed by Visual Studio’s vi mode plugin), more Java,
<a href="http://truongtx.me/2013/05/02/agent-069-game/">Android app programming</a>, and some neat security
tricks. However, none of those intrigued me much, so I decided to start making things for my own:</p>
<section id="Shell-scripts">
<h3>Shell scripts</h3>
<p>If you have taken a look at my <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>, you’ll notice that I
do write a bunch of shell scripts to automate stuff I do often. The one I’m currently proudest of
is <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/rmitproxy_silent">rmiproxy_silent</a>, a
script that automatically detects whether I am using RMIT’s network and set/clear the appropriate
proxy settings. Another one that I can’t live without is
<a href="https://github.com/nhanb/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh">install.sh</a>, a script that helps install
all my dotfiles, sets up zsh and various things. It saved me <strong>a lot</strong> of time whenever I reinstall
my system.</p>
<p>Obligatory shout-out to <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/">oh-my-zsh</a>, greatest invention
since sliced bread! Those guys are awesome!</p>
</section>
<section id="AJMG-then-Pytaku-then-who-knows">
<h3>AJMG, then Pytaku, then… who knows?</h3>
<p>The original idea was actually creating a Java Swing program that helps download manga. It was born
out of frustration of <a href="http://blog.domdomsoft.com/">DomDomSoft</a>, a manga downloader that requires
“donation” to unlock full functionalities. “I could do that, and I’ll open source the crap out of
it, because open source is awesome”, I thought. Then I spent some time and got the minimal program
working program:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ajmg.png"></p>
<p>This program did help me get a firm knowledge of java’s thread manipulation and using http proxy
(so I could exploit RMIT’s awesome network bandwidth). I also succeeded in achieving separation of
concern to a certain level this time, allowing contributors (if any) to easily add support for
other manga reader sites. But then again, Swing’s quirks put me off, so my bad habit of losing
interest quickly kicked in and the project stopped there.</p>
<p>Then came <a href="https://pytaku-legacy.appspot.com">Pytaku</a>, ajmg’s spiritual successor. At this point I
knew enough of python and wanted to try out Google App Engine, so I decided to make a web version
of AJMG, with the difference that instead of downloading directly, it forwards everything to the
user’s Dropbox folder. Why not Google Drive you ask? Because they haven’t even bothered to release
an official Linux client for it. Shame on you, Google!</p>
<p>Loads of exciting things were learned along the way: how URL handling works in webapp2 and in other
web frameworks in general, proper templating (can’t believe I ever wrote <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php echo $title;
?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code>… not cool!), OAuth2 (more than a few “Aha!” moments working with this little guy…),
Google’s Datastore and NoSQL in general, and of course, Twitter Bootstrap–saving clueless
non-designer developers since its inception.</p>
<p>And now, I’m rewriting it from scratch, this time trying out TDD, making use of
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/nhanb/pytaku">travis-ci</a>, which will be especially helpful to periodically
test if a manga site has changed its page layout and screwed up Pytaku’s scraping code. I have
encountered a number of quirks when trying to set up the correct testing boilerplate for a Google
App Engine project, but it seems everything will be smooth from now on. This holiday season I plan
to at least roll out an alpha version to show off. Stay tuned if you’re interested!</p>

<section id="To-sum-it-up">
<h2>To sum it up…</h2>
<p>I don’t believe in developing products I myself don’t want to use. I want to make things that make
my life easier, and if that helps others too then it’s a huge bonus. This is why Github is my
favorite company right now, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyz3jkOBbQY">How GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub</a> remains the
best developer speech I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Right now I haven’t made a full-blown program that I can confidently distribute to end users, but I
certainly have made quite a few nifty tools to improve my day-to-day computing tasks and learned a
lot along the way. Right now I cannot confidently answer this big question by pointing them to a
polished website detailing every nook and cranny of my shiny widely-used, battle-tested program,
but I’m confident I have the right knowledge to get there. If there is such a thing as “Lunar New
Year Resolution”, I guess mine is that one year from now, I will have a satisfying answer to this
question. Watch out world, I’m coming!</p>
<p>If you managed to get here, you are probably a tech geek like me. So, have <strong>you</strong> built anything
cool recently?</p>
