Hi, I'm Nh√¢n. I make webstuff for a living.

![literally me](keyboard-warrior.jpg)

My mind is a sad mess that cannot hold much information after a couple of
months or so. This blog is where I write down interesting things I discover.
On occasional bad days I might throw all my ramblings here too, but hopefully
those will be rare.

This blog is powered by my {-homegrown organic artisanal-} static site generator
called [s4g][1] and is hosted on Github Pages.
Its source code can be found on my [github repo][2].
