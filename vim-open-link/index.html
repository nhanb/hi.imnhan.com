<h1>Opening http link under the cursor in vim</h1>
<p>Mr. <a href="https://www.walterbright.com/">Walter Bright</a>, creator of the D
programming language, recently
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28090272">commented</a> on Hacker News:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And for bug fixes, reference the issue which often gives a detailed
explanation for why the code is a certain way:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd/blob/master/src/dmd/backend/cgxmm.d#L1210">https://github.com/dlang/dmd/blob/master/src/dmd/backend/cgxmm.d#L1210</a></p>
<p>Ever since I enhanced the editor I use to open the browser on links, this
sort of thing has proven to be very, very handy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve never had any issue with opening links from vim: I have <code>&lt;leader&gt;y</code> set up
in Visual mode to yank stuff into the system-wide clipboard which I can then
paste into the browser. However, ever since I mapped <code>&lt;leader&gt;gh</code> to trigger
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/blob/2dc08dfe354ed5400f5cdb3d5009dcd4024aac8a/doc/fugitive.txt#L213"><code>:GBrowse</code></a> that opens a browser tab instantly, the old “select, copy,
alt-tab to browser, ctrl+t, ctrl+v” flow started to feel… prehistoric. Mr.
Bright’s comment gave me the final nudge to actually go ahead and set it up.</p>
<p>The good folks from the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9458294/open-url-under-cursor-in-vim-with-browser">developer encyclopedia</a> suggested <code>gx</code> but for some
reason, setting <code>g:netrw_browsex_viewer</code> <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/4738">didn’t seem to do anything</a> so the
command would always <code>wget</code> the link then tell the browser to open that
downloaded file. Therefore, I cobbled together this snippet which was adapted
from those stackoverflow &amp; github threads:</p>
<pre><code class="language-vimscript">function! OpenURL()
  let l:url = matchstr(expand("&lt;cWORD&gt;"), 'https\=:\/\/[^ &gt;,;()]*')
  if l:url != ""
    let l:url = shellescape(l:url, 1)
    let l:command = "!xdg-open ".l:url
    echo l:command
    silent exec l:command
  else
    echo "No URL found under cursor."
  endif
endfunction

nnoremap gl :call OpenURL()&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><em>(if you’re on a Mac, replacing <code>xdg-open</code> with <code>open</code> will probably
do the same thing)</em></p>
<p>Now whenever I have my cursor on an http(s) url, I can type <code>gl</code> from normal
mode and xdg-open will use my default browser to open it up. This could be
extended to any other scheme like <code>mailto</code> or <code>ftp</code> but I don’t have any
practical use for them right now so that will do.</p>
<p>One drawback is if there’s a whitespace in the URL (which is bad practice
anyway), my regex won’t match the whole thing. In such cases I’d rather resort
to good old manual visual mode than try to be clever and make my URL detecting
logic exponentially more complex. I’d take simple software with obvious, easily
understood behavior over overcomplicated, (possibly) subtly broken balls of mud
any day.</p>
<p>By the way, if you looked at my script and got spooked by the idea of executing
a shell command composed from arbitrary, potentially unsafe input (i.e. text
file content), don’t worry: that’s what <a href="https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/32.html#escaping-shell-command-arguments"><code>shellescape()</code></a> is for.</p>
<section id="But-why-stop-there">
<h2>But why stop there?</h2>
<p>We’re using Jira at work (I know, don’t ask), and we have a convention to
include the Jira ticket in all top-level git commit messages like this (French
optional):</p>
<pre><code>[SRE-123456] Finally fix the goddamn pipeline
</code></pre>
<p>That’s no URL, but the jira ticket ID pattern is pretty simple, so I simply
altered the regexp a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-vimscript">function! OpenJira()
  let l:jira_id = toupper(matchstr(expand("&lt;cWORD&gt;"), '\c\(id2\|sre\|csi\)-[0-9]\+'))
  if l:jira_id != ""
    let l:command = "!xdg-open https://my-company.atlassian.net/browse/".l:jira_id
    echo l:command
    silent exec l:command
  else
    echo "No Jira ticket found under cursor."
  endif
endfunction
nnoremap gj :call OpenJira()&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Voila! Now I can press <code>gj</code> to open any atlassian ticket from just its ID.</p>
<p>Some interesting points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>ID2/SRE/CSI</code> are the prefixes that I know of. No idea if there are any
other. Would be trivial to add later anyway.
</li>
<li>
Because the pattern of <code>l:jira_id</code> is very simple, I don’t even need to
shellescape() this one.
</li>
<li>
I didn’t even bother to refactor common stuff between the OpenURL() and
OpenJira().
</li>
</ul>
<p>On a more big-picture note, I can afford to make seemingly sloppy decisions
precisely because this serves only myself, and my specific use cases are
usually narrow. It’s not very general, but it works, and works precisely the
way I want it. This is one of the reasons I’ve always preferred simple tooling
that I can build upon, rather than following the prescribed workflows of more
full-fledged IDEs.</p>
<p>I’m not bashing IDEs, and I’m in no way promoting vim or <a href="https://github.com/DigitalMars/med">rolling your own
emacs</a>. I’m firmly in the “use whatever
you’re comfortable with” camp. I think the whole idea of editor/IDE wars is
juvenile, dumb and counterproductive (all software sucks in some way anyway,
fight me). Showing nifty tricks you can do with your tools, inspiring others to
either check them out or implement those on their own tools, just like how Mr.
Bright has done with his little comment, is a much better use of everyone’s
time. I think.</p>
