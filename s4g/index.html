<h1>s4g is a Stupidly Simple Static Site Generator</h1>

<p>This blog is now built with <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/s4g">s4g</a>—a static site generator (SSG) made by
yours truly.</p>
<section id="Why">
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>What sets s4g apart from typical SSGs is that it doesn’t separate source code
and output. For a concrete example, <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> would read source from the
/content/ dir and write a complete website to /output/, like this:</p>
<pre><code>my-blog
├── content &lt;-- source
│   ├── pages
│   │   ├── about.md
│   │   └── home.md
│   └── posts
│       ├── first-post.md
│       └── second-post.md
└── output &lt;-- generated website ready to be served
    ├── about
    │   └── index.html
    ├── home
    │   └── index.html
    └── posts
        ├── first-post
        │   └── index.html
        └── second-post
            └── index.html
</code></pre>
<p>While s4g would simply put the processed html right next to its source (s4g
uses djot instead of markdown, so source files are .dj instead of .md):</p>
<pre><code>my-blog &lt;-- is both source and serveable website
├── about
│   ├── index.dj
│   └── index.html
├── home
│   ├── index.dj
│   └── index.html
└── posts
    ├── first-post
    │   ├── index.dj
    │   └── index.html
    └── second-post
        ├── index.dj
        └── index.html
</code></pre>
<p>This simplifies a few things:</p>
<section id="1-Folder-layout-is-website-layout">
<h3>1. Folder layout <em>is</em> website layout</h3>
<p>With Pelican you typically need to supply a few url patterns to let
the generator know where to put the generated html:</p>
<pre><code>ARTICLE_PATHS = ["posts"]
ARTICLE_URL = "posts/{slug}/"
ARTICLE_SAVE_AS = "posts/{slug}/index.html"
ARTICLE_LANG_URL = "posts/{slug}-{lang}/"
ARTICLE_LANG_SAVE_AS = "posts/{slug}-{lang}/index.html"
</code></pre>
<p>While with s4g you just put the .dj file where you want the .html to end up.</p>
</section>
<section id="2-Obvious-static-asset-placement">
<h3>2. Obvious static asset placement</h3>
<p>A post typically links to static assets such as images or videos.
Ideally we want to put these assets in the same place as their content file.
This is surprisingly tricky with Pelican: you have to either throw every
asset of every post in one big static folder, or carefully tweak the url
settings and use a custom link syntax, as per <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/4.8.0/content.html#mixed-content-in-the-same-directory">their docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Placing static and content source files together in the same source
directory does not guarantee that they will end up in the same place in the
generated site. The easiest way to do this is by using the <code>{attach}</code> link
syntax (described below). Alternatively, the <code>STATIC_SAVE_AS</code>,
<code>PAGE_SAVE_AS</code>, and <code>ARTICLE_SAVE_AS</code> settings (and the corresponding <code>*_URL</code>
settings) can be configured to place files of different types together, just
as they could in earlier versions of Pelican.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With s4g, we can simply put asset files in the same folder as the <code>index.dj</code>
file, and use relative links when referencing them in the djot body.
Here’s an example from my blog:</p>
<pre><code># a post's folder structure:

sqlite-python/
├── byte_databases.jpg &lt;-- asset
├── index.dj           &lt;-- source
└── index.html         &lt;-- generated html

# in index.dj, to generate an img tag:

![](byte_databases.jpg)
</code></pre>
<p>No custom url syntax needed, and any djot previewer will have no problem
picking up the image (assuming djot gets popular enough to get previewer
support in the first place).</p>
</section>
<section id="3-Easy-post-grouping">
<h3>3. Easy post grouping</h3>
<p>Sometimes I write a series of related posts, and want to make it obvious when
a visitor lands on any such post. The s4g solution: put them all in a folder.
Here’s a <a href="https://hi.imnhan.com/movie-streaming/">live example</a> from my blog:</p>
<pre><code>movie-streaming/              &lt;-- series home
├── gflick                    &lt;-- post
│   ├── index.dj
│   └── index.html
├── gflick-fixed              &lt;-- post
│   ├── gflick_01_mobile.png
│   ├── index.dj
│   └── index.html
├── index.dj
├── index.html
└── put.io                    &lt;-- post
    ├── index.dj
    ├── index.html
    └── put.io-drag-n-drop.mp4
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the content of <code>/movie-streaming/index.dj</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Title: The movie streaming saga
ShowInFeed: false
PageType: series-index
---

It's the 2020s. Fiber-to-the-home bandwidth is plentiful.
Follow me on this journey to find the best movie streaming experience for the
ethically flexible. _ThE EnD mIgHT sHoCK yOu._
</code></pre>
<p>When s4g finds a .dj with <code>PageType: series-index</code>, it treats the page as a
series index, and its direct subfolders as posts in this series.</p>
<p>The series index renders its list of posts in addition to its own djot content:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="series-index.png"></p>
<p>Each post in the series has a extra header and footer:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="series-header.png"></p>
<p><img alt="" src="series-footer.png"></p>
</section>
<section id="Miscellaneous-blog-things">
<h3>Miscellaneous blog things</h3>
<p>An RSS feed is table stakes, so that’s what you get out of the box.
Technically it’s an Atom feed, but hey, tomaytoes-tomahtoes.</p>
<p>There’s also automatic OpenGraph / Twitter Cards meta tags, so you get those
sweet preview widgets when sharing your links on social media or rich chat
applications.</p>
<p>Cool links don’t die, but sometimes you do want to change a post’s URL. In such
cases, simply add a line to <strong>_s4g/redirects.txt</strong> that says:</p>
<pre><code>old-link/index.html -&gt; new-link/
</code></pre>
<p>S4g will then generate an html with the appropriate <code>&lt;meta
http-equiv="Refresh" ... &gt;</code> tag to redirect visitors to your new location. I
heard this works on googlebot too! Anyway, this is how I updated all of my old
lengthy paths e.g. “posts/introducing-mcross-a-minimal-gemini-browser” to
short, typeable paths such as “mcross”.</p>
</section>
<section id="Quality-of-life-stuff">
<h3>Quality-of-life stuff</h3>
<p>I originally wanted to use s4g as a teaching tool for a sort of “Learning
HTML/CSS by creating a blog” tutorial series, but lost interest halfway. It
still resulted in a few user-friendly goodies: out-of-the box livereload,
a custom human-friendly metadata syntax, error message shown directly on the
browser (still incomplete: it includes the offending file and field, but no
line number yet), etc.</p>
<p>The livereload turns out to be quite handy: it feels especially nice to edit my
css, save and see the change instantly on my phone browser.</p>
</section>
<section id="Risks">
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>Since source and output live in the same folder, there’s a non-zero chance that
some bug in s4g may eat your source data. I obviously don’t want that to
happen, but I haven’t tested it rigorously. Therefore, I only run s4g on
version-controlled websites, and recommend users do the same.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="Quickstart">
<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<p>I probably won’t bother to write proper documentation any time soon, because
let’s face it: I’m probably going to be s4g’s only user.</p>
<p>However, if you’re curious enough to tinker with it, the following should
get you started:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Install
sudo pacman -Syu nodejs go
go install go.imnhan.com/s4g@latest

# Create first blog
s4g new -f ~/blog
cd ~/blog
s4g # start webserver at localhost:8000 and listen for changes
</code></pre>
<p>Visit <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a> and you’ll see a blank home page.
To add your first post, create a new <code>hello.dj</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>Title: Hello world
PostedAt: 2023-01-02 19:00
---

Why _hello_ there!
</code></pre>
<p>The home page will now auto-refresh, showing your newly minted “hello world”.</p>
<p>For more elaborate examples, check out the <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/s4g/tree/master/docs">sample site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/hi.imnhan.com">my own
blog</a>, which cover hidden posts, deploying on sub-directory paths, custom &amp;
fallback thumbnails, per-post custom templates, series, among other things.</p>
