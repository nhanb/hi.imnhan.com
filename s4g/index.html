<h1>s4g is a Stupidly Simple Static Site Generator</h1>

<p>This blog is now built with <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/s4g">s4g</a>—an experimental static site generator.</p>
<section id="Why">
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Unlike typical static site generators, s4g doesn’t separate source code and
output. For a concrete example, <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> would read source from the
/content/ dir and write a complete website to /output/, like this:</p>
<pre><code>my-blog
├── content &lt;-- source
│   ├── pages
│   │   ├── about.md
│   │   └── home.md
│   └── posts
│       ├── first-post.md
│       └── second-post.md
└── output &lt;-- generated website ready to be served
    ├── about
    │   └── index.html
    ├── home
    │   └── index.html
    └── posts
        ├── first-post
        │   └── index.html
        └── second-post
            └── index.html
</code></pre>
<p>s4g, on the other hand, simply looks for .dj files (s4g uses djot instead of
markdown) and generates a matching .html in the same place:</p>
<pre><code>my-blog &lt;-- is both source and serveable website
├── about
│   ├── index.dj
│   └── index.html
├── home
│   ├── index.dj
│   └── index.html
└── posts
    ├── first-post
    │   index.dj
    │   index.html
    └── second-post
        ├── index.dj
        └── index.html
</code></pre>
<p>This is certainly not a novel idea. In fact, one can glob over their dir with a
pandoc command and <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/gbvs.saigonfgc.com/blob/26e50c676c3c060310b292f1c520753cf34210fc/build.py">be done with it</a>. The fun starts when you want to
generate things that need aggregate data, a home index, series index, RSS feed,
etc… While we’re at it, why not add rebuild-on-save, livereload, the whole
shebang? One thing led to another, and s4g was born.</p>
<p>This dumb approach to paths simplifies a few things:</p>
<section id="1-Folder-layout-is-website-layout">
<h3>1. Folder layout <em>is</em> website layout</h3>
<p>With Pelican we typically need to supply a few url patterns to let
the generator know where to put the generated html:</p>
<pre><code>ARTICLE_PATHS = ["posts"]
ARTICLE_URL = "posts/{slug}/"
ARTICLE_SAVE_AS = "posts/{slug}/index.html"
ARTICLE_LANG_URL = "posts/{slug}-{lang}/"
ARTICLE_LANG_SAVE_AS = "posts/{slug}-{lang}/index.html"
</code></pre>
<p>While with s4g we just put the .dj file where we want the .html to end up.</p>
</section>
<section id="2-Obvious-static-asset-placement">
<h3>2. Obvious static asset placement</h3>
<p>A post typically links to static assets such as images or videos.
Ideally we want to put these assets in the same place as their content file.
This is surprisingly tricky with Pelican: we have to either throw every
asset of every post in one big static folder, or carefully tweak the url
settings and use a custom link syntax, as per <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/4.8.0/content.html#mixed-content-in-the-same-directory">their docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Placing static and content source files together in the same source
directory does not guarantee that they will end up in the same place in the
generated site. The easiest way to do this is by using the <code>{attach}</code> link
syntax (described below). Alternatively, the <code>STATIC_SAVE_AS</code>,
<code>PAGE_SAVE_AS</code>, and <code>ARTICLE_SAVE_AS</code> settings (and the corresponding <code>*_URL</code>
settings) can be configured to place files of different types together, just
as they could in earlier versions of Pelican.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With s4g, we can simply put asset files in the same folder as the <code>index.dj</code>
file, and use relative links when referencing them in the djot body.
Here’s an example from my blog:</p>
<pre><code># a post's folder structure:

sqlite-python/
├── byte_databases.jpg &lt;-- asset
├── index.dj           &lt;-- source
└── index.html         &lt;-- generated html

# in index.dj, to generate an img tag:

![](byte_databases.jpg)
</code></pre>
<p>No custom url syntax needed, and any djot previewer will have no problem
picking up the image (assuming djot gets popular enough to get previewer
support in the first place).</p>
</section>
<section id="3-Easy-post-grouping">
<h3>3. Easy post grouping</h3>
<p>Sometimes I write a series of related posts, and want to make it obvious when
a visitor lands on any such post. The s4g solution: put them all in a folder.
Here’s a <a href="https://hi.imnhan.com/movie-streaming/">live example</a> from my blog:</p>
<pre><code>movie-streaming/              &lt;-- series home
├── gflick                    &lt;-- post
│   ├── index.dj
│   └── index.html
├── gflick-fixed              &lt;-- post
│   ├── gflick_01_mobile.png
│   ├── index.dj
│   └── index.html
├── index.dj
├── index.html
└── put.io                    &lt;-- post
    ├── index.dj
    ├── index.html
    └── put.io-drag-n-drop.mp4
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the content of <code>/movie-streaming/index.dj</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Title: The movie streaming saga
ShowInFeed: false
PageType: series-index
---

It's the 2020s. Fiber-to-the-home bandwidth is plentiful.
Follow me on this journey to find the best movie streaming experience for the
ethically flexible. _ThE EnD mIgHT sHoCK yOu._
</code></pre>
<p>When s4g finds a .dj with <code>PageType: series-index</code>, it treats the page as a
series index, and its direct subfolders as posts in this series.</p>
<p>The series index renders its list of posts in addition to its own djot content:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="series-index.png"></p>
<p>Each post in the series has a extra header and footer:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="series-header.png"></p>
<p><img alt="" src="series-footer.png"></p>
</section>
<section id="Miscellaneous-blog-things">
<h3>Miscellaneous blog things</h3>
<p>An RSS feed is table stakes, so that’s what we get out of the box.
Technically it’s an Atom feed, but hey, tomaytoes-tomahtoes.</p>
<p>There’s also automatic OpenGraph / Twitter Cards meta tags, so we get those
sweet preview widgets when sharing links on social media or rich chat
applications.</p>
<p>Cool links don’t die, but sometimes we do want to change a post’s URL. In such
cases, simply add a line to <strong>_s4g/redirects.txt</strong> that says:</p>
<pre><code>old-link/index.html -&gt; new-link/
</code></pre>
<p>S4g will then generate <strong>old-link/index.html</strong> with the appropriate <code>&lt;meta
http-equiv="Refresh" ...&gt;</code> tag to redirect visitors to the new location. I
heard this works on googlebot too! Anyway, this is how I updated all of my old
lengthy paths e.g. “posts/introducing-mcross-a-minimal-gemini-browser” to
short, typeable paths such as “mcross”.</p>
</section>
<section id="Quality-of-life-stuff">
<h3>Quality-of-life stuff</h3>
<p>I originally wanted to use s4g as a teaching tool for a sort of “Learning
HTML/CSS by creating a blog” tutorial series, but lost interest halfway. It
still resulted in a few user-friendly goodies: out-of-the box livereload,
a custom human-friendly metadata syntax, error message shown directly on the
browser (still incomplete: it includes the offending file and field, but no
line number yet), etc.</p>
<p>The livereload turns out to be quite handy: it feels especially nice to edit my
css, save and see the change instantly on my phone browser.</p>

<section id="Quickstart">
<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Install
sudo pacman -Syu nodejs go
go install go.imnhan.com/s4g@latest

# Create first blog
s4g new -f ~/blog
cd ~/blog
s4g # start webserver at localhost:8000 and listen for changes
</code></pre>
<p>Visit <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a> and you’ll see a blank home page.
To add your first post, create a new <code>hello.dj</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>Title: Hello world
PostedAt: 2023-01-02 19:00
---

Why _hello_ there!
</code></pre>
<p>The home page will now auto-refresh, showing your newly minted “hello world”.</p>
<p>For more elaborate examples, check out the <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/s4g/tree/master/docs">sample site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/hi.imnhan.com">my own
blog</a>, which cover hidden posts, deploying on sub-directory paths, custom &amp;
fallback thumbnails, per-post custom templates, series, among other things.</p>

<h2>Questionables</h2>
<section id="Djot">
<h3>Djot?</h3>
<p>Imagine markdown but not full of corner cases and highly extensible. I’m glad
jgm didn’t try to fold this into commonmark. Let John Gruber keep his weird toy
non-spec “format”. Let me be clear though, I have no ill will towards
Gruber—his thing worked for his purposes, but it’s a tragedy that we as an
industry failed to converge on a more technically sound format for lightweight
text markup.</p>
</section>
<section id="Since-source-and-output-live-in-the-same-folder-will-some-bug-in-s4g-eat-my-source">
<h3>Since source and output live in the same folder, will some bug in s4g eat
my source?</h3>
<p>I obviously try to avoid that, but the current code is proof-of-concept
quality. Therefore, I only run s4g on version-controlled websites, and
recommend users do the same for now.</p>
</section>
<section id="Adding-compiled-assets-to-version-control-sounds-bad">
<h3>Adding compiled assets to version control sounds… bad?</h3>
<p>For programs, probably.
For websites though, I prefer to keep snapshots of the whole website as it’s
deployed, and be able to roll it back together with the source code. Admittedly
this makes for noisy diffs sometimes, but I’ll be sly here and call it a UI
problem ;)</p>
</section>
<section id="I-just-looked-at-the-code-and-holy-crap-what-s-with-all-those-non-data-structures-and-nested-loops">
<h3>I just looked at the code and holy crap what’s with all those (non) data
structures and nested loops!</h3>
<p>Yeah but the whole thing takes about 100ms on my thirty-something-articles
blog, which is by no means impressive, but not a real hindrance for daily use
either. If an actual user shows up with a site big enough to have a problem,
I’ll look into optimizing it.</p>
