<h1>My first DIY fightstick: Part 1</h1>

<p>Ever since I started practicing Street Fighter seriously (albeit with modest results), I’ve
always wanted to make myself a custom fightstick. Now that I’m not working full-time for anyone,
there’s no better time to Just Do It.</p>
<p>If you’ve done any research on DIY fightsticks, you’ll know that the 2 best places to find guides
are <a href="http://www.slagcoin.com/">Slagcoin</a> and <a href="http://forums.shoryuken.com/categories/tech-talk">Shoryuken Tech Talk</a>. I decided to follow the <a href="http://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/example2.html">basic
design</a> on Slagcoin:</p>

<h2>Materials and tools<a href="#Materials-and-tools" class="heading-link">#</a></h2>
<p>If you live in Hồ Chí Minh City like me, you can probably get everything you need from shops on
Bạch Đằng Street. The only hard part for me was convincing a small wood shop to sell MDF panels cut
to my specifications in small quantity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
4 pieces x 30cm x 20cm x 1cm *
</li>
<li>
2 pieces x 20cm x 4cm x 2cm
</li>
<li>
2 pieces x 20cm x 7cm x 2cm
</li>
<li>
1 piece x 26cm x 4cm x 2cm
</li>
<li>
4 pieces x 34cm x 7cm x 2cm *
</li>
</ul>
<p>All that set me back 120,000 VND. The cost was mostly for cutting labor instead of actual material.
The items with asterisks (*) are those I bought in abundance to make room for drilling errors.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_01_mdf.jpg"></p>
<p>The top panel would be layered with 1 MDF and 2 plexiglass pieces (mad illustrating skillz, I
know):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_02_top_plan.jpg"></p>
<p>The bottom would simply be 1 MDF and 1 plexiglass so I could also insert bottom artwork.</p>
<p>Since I had zero woodworking experience, I joined the MDF pieces with simple butt joints and good
old wood glue. You’ll notice that there’s a significant gap on one corner - turns out the shop
wasn’t too accurate with their cutting. It’s not shown here but eventually I had to saw a longer
MDF piece to replace it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_03_glue.jpg"></p>
<p>I already had a hand drill laying around so all it took was buying a couple of hole saws - 24mm and
30mm in diameter respectively. The bigger one was used for drilling main button holes while the
other was for joystick hole and smaller front side buttons.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_04_hole_saw.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Don’t buy</em> hole saws like the one below - you will not be able to drill through thick panels
(like the 20mm thick one I bought):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_05_nope_saw.jpg"></p>
<p>As for the actual parts, I ordered the joystick and buttons from <a href="https://www.akishop.jp/">Akishop</a>. It ships from
Japan so the shipping cost to Vietnam is much more reasonable than if I buy from the US. I also
bought a <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Zero-Delay-USB-Encoder-to-PC-Joystick-For-Arcade-DIY-KIT-Sanwa-Parts-MAME-/191558265304?hash=item2c99c329d8#shpCntId">Zero Delay PCB kit</a> from ebay. This one even offers free shipping since it’s from
China. This kit offers easy solder-free wires too so it saved me from a lot of trouble (I still
can’t find where to quick-disconnect terminals to this date). I connected everything to my PC to
test if things worked as expected:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_26_electronics.jpg"></p>
<p>Quick note: the popular wisdom is to buy screw-in buttons for thick panels and scap-in for thin
ones. However, as my panel is <em>way</em> too thick even for screw-ins, snap-ins are actually the better
choice: you just need to put the buttons in normally - the 2 sides of the button will push against
the hole and keep it there fairly firmly. I never had a problem with my previous stick which was
build this way.</p>

<section id="Actually-making-it">
<h2>Actually making it<a href="#Actually-making-it" class="heading-link">#</a></h2>
<p>I drilled holes in the front side: first using the 30mm bit to drill halfway, then went all the way
with the 24mm bit. This allows a small button to be placed deep into the case, avoiding
accidentally button presses.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_06_front_holes.jpg"></p>
<p>Then I glued the case body together. I didn’t have big clamps laying around so I had to make do
with an elastic string. It worked terribly though.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_07_glue_body.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the bottom panel was just there to keep the whole thing in shape. I took it out later:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_08_glue_body2.jpg"></p>
<p>See the gap in the top left corner? That’s the gap I was talking about earlier. Good thing I had a
spare piece laying around, so I sawed it to the correct length to use as a replacement:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_09_saw_side.jpg"></p>
<p>Now everything fitted together but there was some excess on one long side. Much sanding awaits!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_10_excess.jpg"></p>
<p>Initial sanding effort with 140 grit sandpaper:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_11_sanded.jpg"></p>
<p>By the way, I recommend using a sanding block. It helps you apply more pressure evenly. I simply
wrapped my sandpaper around a spare piece of MDF:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_12_sanding_block.jpg"></p>
<p>Now on to the inner sides. These would support the top and bottom panels. I used a long piece of
scrap plexiglass to apply pressure instead of a clamp. This time I put one 10mm-thick wood panel
and one 3mm-thick plexiglass panel under it to make sure the inner supports are glued at the
correct position.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_13_inner_support.jpg"></p>
<p>With all 3 inner sides glued:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_14_inner_support2.jpg"></p>
<p>Now you must be wondering why I had 2 inner pieces on the left side. I originally wanted to save
some space and weight by sawing those into shorter support bits instead of long whole pieces that
covered the full length. After sawing the first piece I decided that it wasn’t worth the effort
anyway so… there you have it.</p>
<p>Here comes the next challenge: putting paint on the MDF. There is an <a href="http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/67501/how-to-paint-mdf-to-a-mirror-finish-worklog">extremely elaborate
method</a> explained on Shoryuken Tech Talk that helps you achieve a mirror-like glossy
finish. Of course I don’t have the tools and patience to follow all that, but I followed the first
few steps (cover edges with non-absorbent material, sand and spray paint multiple times) to achieve
an acceptably smooth finish.</p>
<p>Here’s the first step: cover edges with non-absorbent material. The tutorial suggested using
spackling, which I have no idea how to obtain from here. I settled with something Vietnamese people
“matic” (mastic, perhaps?) which my friends said was to be used for the same purpose. The thing was
yellow-ish and much more runny than spackling. It was also difficult as hell to work with: the
moment it’s spread on the MDF edge, it starts drying, at which point you can’t touch it again
unless you want an ugly grungy finish (is that even a word?):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_15_mastic.jpg"></p>
<p>I waited for the yellow thing to dry, then sanded it again. After a first few coats with glossy
black spray paint, things didn’t look too sexy:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_16_first_coat.jpg"></p>
<p>It did get better with sanding (1200 grit) and more coats though. But then I made the most stupid
decision: glueing the top panel on before drilling:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_17_top_panel.jpg"></p>
<p>Now why was this bad? Because now I would be forced to drill top panel holes <em>with</em> the whole body
attached, which will expose the whole thing to sawdust, which was generally PITA to clean up - the
top panel made it a closed shape with corners and spaces all over the place. Also, if I screwed up
the top MDF panel (which I eventually kinda did), the whole thing would be ruined.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, I did paint it too. The paint layer would later make disgusting drill
holes:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_18_joystick_hole.jpg"></p>
<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself. Here’s how the case looked after a few more black coats and one
clear coat (also put buttons in there to see how they fit):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_19_finished_coat.jpg"></p>
<p>I did drill an extra button hole because I realized I’d need the “Playstation” button too if I want
to use a PS4 controller PCB later (which I plan to do). Unfortunately I only ordered 2 small
buttons from Akishop so I had to use a green Chinese button I had laying around.</p>
<p>Now here comes the hard part: drilling the top panel. As mentioned earlier, the top panel would be
3-layer:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_02_top_plan.jpg"></p>
<p>I placed all 3 pieces onto the case, but with the 4mm plexiglass on top (in the plan it’s supposed
to be in the middle - I’ll explain later). Then I printed the Blast City button layout found on
Slagcoin and taped it onto the whole thing:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_20_top_layout.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice the extra two holes I drew above and below the joystick hole. Those are for screw holes for
mounting the joystick. This is why I put the 4mm piece on top: I was going to drill these two holes
on the 4mm piece only to leave room for screw heads. This way I didn’t need to “route” the extra 2
holes on my MDF piece like the original plan (I was afraid the 10mm MDF thickness was already too
thin).</p>
<p>After drilling the necessary holes, I removed the plexiglass pieces and drilled the aformentioned 2
joystick mounting holes into to MDF, then I placed the joystick mounting plate onto the surface to
plot the rectangular part that needed to be cut off:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_21_joystick_square.jpg"></p>
<p>Since I don’t have any power tool, I used my handy hand drill with the circular hole saw to
gradually drill out the shape:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_22_joystick_drills.jpg"></p>
<p>After much sanding and cleaning:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_18_joystick_hole.jpg"></p>
<p>See the glorious tears? That’s what premature painting does to you. Friends don’t let friends paint
prematurely!</p>
<p>Anyway, I also drilled 3 hole on the bottom to install the bottom pieces (1 MDF &amp; 1 plexiglass). I
also printed a quick picture as a placeholder artwork to see how it would look:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_23_bottom.jpg"></p>
<p>As I was excited to finish the putting the top panel together, I hit a wall: because I couldn’t
possibly drill perfectly perpendicular screw holes, they could not property attach:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_25_loose_screw.jpg"></p>
<p>Also, thanks to the switching positions between the two plexiglass pieces, the button holes didn’t
align anymore. I had to waste a buttload of time sanding the lower piece’s holes to make them
bigger.</p>
<p>But that’s not even the worst issue: because the screw holes were not aligned, once I screwed all
four corners, the top plexiglass piece flexed, creating a blatantly noticeable gap:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_24_gap.jpg"></p>

<h2>Um… that’s it (for now).<a href="#Um-that-s-it-for-now" class="heading-link">#</a></h2>
<p>That’s all of my progress so far. I’m visiting my <a href="http://fablabsaigon.org/">local Fablab</a>, which is advertised to
have CNC machines and laser cutters so I’ll probably have a chance to produce more accurate panels.
Hell, I may even redo the whole thing using machine-cut pieces for absolute accuracy and save
myself from a world of pain.</p>
<p>Till next time!</p>
