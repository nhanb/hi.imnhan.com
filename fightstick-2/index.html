<h1>My first DIY fightstick: Part 2</h1>

<p>It’s been a while since I <a href="../fightstick-1/">started</a> my arcade stick project. To be honest I got lazy and paused
the whole thing for a while, but yesterday I needed a distraction so… everything came together
much more nicely than I thought!</p>
<section id="I-did-it">
<h2>I did it!</h2>
<p>I was almost done in Part 1, except for the fact that button holes on the top panels didn’t align,
and the topmost panel flexed a bit because of imprecise screw holes:</p>
<p><img alt="Ewww" src="../fightstick-1/fightstick_24_gap.jpg"></p>
<p>To fix the button holes, I simply wrapped my roughest sandpaper around the drill bit and used it as
a poor man’s sander to make the holes slightly bigger, just enough for buttons to fit. This took a
while because the sandpaper pieces kept failing on me. Good thing I stock a huge roll in the first
place! :-)</p>
<p>The flexing panel was surprisingly trivial to fix: I simply made one corner’s hole a bit bigger to
allow its screw to go all the way in properly. No more stupid gaps!</p>
<p>Now that every piece was how it should be, the fun part began: assembling. The inside looked like
this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick2_01_wires.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice the knot where the USB cable poked out? It was there as a safeguard against pulling so that
the PCB doesn’t get yanked around. Later on I actually labeled every pair of wires for each button
and secured the PCB better with more resilient tape, but I forgot to take photos and I’m now too
lazy to open up the whole thing again so… you get the idea.</p>
<p>As for the top panel artwork, I planned quite a few colored designs, but was too lazy to go to a
printing shop. As luck would have it, I had a black and white printer at home, so I grabbed some
random Galford image on the internet and printed out one sheet just to see how it would look. It
turned out much better than expected so I kept it that way.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick2_02_top.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that I bought translucent buttons. These are worth the higher price tag because it is possible
to take them apart and <a href="http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/25926/guide-how-to-put-art-under-clear-seimitsu-buttons">insert artwork pieces</a> under the cover. Just google custom fightsticks
and you’ll find people making use of these buttons with <a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25628/2658140-photo+oct+04,+7+24+53+pm.jpg">stunning</a> <a href="http://technabob.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/custom-steampunk-fight-stick-by-sam-kurd-aka-b15sdm-designs.jpg">results</a>. But then again,
I’m a lazy butt so my minimalistic design actually saved me from some tedious button modding.
Maybe when I get better inspirations, maybe.</p>
<p>Following the monochrome theme, the placeholder “Ken Flowchart” bottom piece from last post became
official (I also trimmed the excess paper later):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="fightstick_23_bottom.jpg"></p>
<p>Oh, and here’s a front shot for completeness’ sake:</p>

<section id="Thoughts">
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>All in all, this turned out much better than I expected. The whole thing feels solid to play with,
and the plexiglass top panel makes a nice feeling palm rest. However, since I went a bit liberal on
panel layers, it’s a tad heavier than my previous stick (which is already heavier than your average
big brand sticks). On the flip side, I can be more aggressive with my joystick spinning sessions
thanks to the extra weight.</p>
<p>I’m also thinking of adding non-slip padding to the bottom. I almost exclusively play with the
fightstick on my lap so it’s not actually necessary gameplay-wise, but without padding, the bottom
screw heads stick out and would definitely scratch my table whenever I place the stick on it.
Better be safe than sorry!</p>
<p>That’s it! This project has been fun, and to me it served as an awesome gateway drug to the DIY
world. Hopefully I inspired some of you to start your own projects too. Let me know how it goes!</p>
