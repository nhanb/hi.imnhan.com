<h1>Look ma, no stock theme!</h1>

<p><strong>2023 Update</strong>: I just realized that em dashes in certain default sans-serif
fonts look terrible (no space around the dash), so I now explicitly use Source
Sans Pro and Ubuntu Mono. Using specific fonts allow me to fine-tune my
typography again (e.g. making code block text a bit smaller).</p>
<p>The extra http load is not that bad: each woff2 font variant averages at 50KB,
and is only loaded if a page’s content actually calls for it. A particularly
<a href="../sqlite-python/">bad case</a> loads 6 variants, clocking in at ~300KB. I can live with that.</p>
<p>I also took this chance to go full black-on-white, which I think looks way
crisper than black-on-cornsilk.</p>
<p><strong>2020 Update</strong>: I bit the bullet and removed all web fonts, relying on the
browser’s configured sans-serif/monospace fonts instead. It’s probably fine,
since even stock fonts seem to cover Vietnamese glyphs well these days.
Otherwise, people who care enough to be bothered by fallback fonts are likely
to know how to configure their browser with proper fonts anyway.</p>
<p><strong>2017 Update</strong>: Now that I like high contrast more, I just updated the
theme to a black/white/red palette with a <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif-pro">high-quality serif font</a>
instead. Thanks <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Mr. Butterick</a>!</p>
<p>The original post follows.</p>

<p>I just redesigned my blog.</p>
<p>To be totally honest, the previous design was not mine at all. I’ve always been using
<a href="https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme/">pelican-octopress-theme</a>, which is a Pelican port of the default theme for Octopress. It’s not
that I have anything to complain about that theme: it was clean, readable and easy on the eyes. I
just want my site to look unique. Content is king, sure, but it wouldn’t hurt to stand out from the
crowd once in a while.</p>
<p>I’m not a professional designer, but everything turned out quite well if I could say so. In this
post I’ll explain my design goals and how I (hopefully) achieved them.</p>
<section id="Clean-and-lightweight">
<h2>Clean and lightweight</h2>
<p>The web is messy. I’m not talking blinking-marquee-fire-animated-header messy (thank god we’re done
with that… <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#Effects">or are we?</a>). I’m talking megabytes-of-useless-javascript-and-css messy. For
whatever reason, some people now think it’s cool to include Bootstrap/Foundation to every project,
or to include that new shiny parallax library to ruin scrolling for everybody. Oh, and don’t forget
the marvellous invention that is <a href="https://xkcd.com/1309/">“infinite scrolling”</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/infinite_scrolling.png"></p>
<p>In fact, the main motivation of my new theme is <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this satire page</a> on the sad state of the web
we’re in today.</p>
<p>That’s why I decided to do no fancy cosmetic JS and try to keep my use of static assets to a
minimum:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="mofo_01_loads.png"></p>
<p>I guess there’s nothing I can do about the font files though, since I need to make sure my
Vietnamese posts are rendered in a font that supports it. Oh well, at least it looks awesome.</p>
</section>
<section id="Content-is-king">
<h2>Content is king</h2>
<p>No more distracting sidebar with “latest news”, “related posts”, etc. with thumbnails popping up
all over the place, just a good old article body from start to finish.</p>
</section>
<section id="Easy-on-the-eye">
<h2>Easy on the eye</h2>
<p>While <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a> does a good job at demonstrating how far you can go with a
few simple CSS rules (hint: very far), I found Tommi Kaikkonen’s <a href="http://www.kaikkonendesign.fi/typography/">Interactive Guide to Blog
Typography</a> much more comprehensive and informative. I implemented many of the ideas found
in that guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Big body font
</li>
<li>
Constrained line width to aid reading
</li>
<li>
Generous line height, liberal whitespace to help with visual hierarchy
</li>
<li>
Lower background-foreground contrast. I also find the slightly yellow-ish background somewhat
soothing.
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="That-s-it">
<h2>That’s it!</h2>
<p>You can find the source code to my theme <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/motherfucking-pelican-theme">on GitHub</a>. I don’t recommend using it as-is though,
since I haven’t implemented many required templates (authors, tags, categories, etc.) because I
don’t use them. There’s also the hardcoded content in footer and probably a few more places. Maybe
someday I’ll stop being lazy and fix all that. <em>Maybe</em>.</p>
