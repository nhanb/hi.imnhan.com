<h1>Installing programs in Ubuntu</h1>
<p>This article will not only explain how to install stuff, but it will (hopefully) also give readers
a better understanding about Linux’s structure for storing and executing programs, ultimately
appreciate the usefulness of package managers in general.</p>
<section id="Executables">
<h2>Executables</h2>
<p>Let’s start with something simple. Fire up your favorite text editor and create a file called
<code>itc.sh</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">#!/bin/bash
notify-send "Hello world!"
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s say I put it at the desktop. Now open up a terminal, go to the Desktop directory and make
our itc file executable. In case you’re new, here are the commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd /home/your_username/Desktop
chmod +x itc.sh
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Protip</strong>: for the first command you can also type <code>cd ~/Desktop</code>, because <code>~</code> is the shorthand for
your home directory (<code>/home/username</code>)</p>
<p>With the <code>chmod</code> command, we made it possible to run our little script by typing its full path:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">~/Desktop/itc.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Another shorthand to make your life easier: <code>.</code> stands for “current directory”, meaning if you are
currently in the <code>~/Desktop</code> directory, you can run the script by simply typing:</p>
<pre><code>./itc.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Either way, a notification saying “Hello world!” should pop up. This is a program in its
simplest form: an executable file. In this particular example it is a Bash script, but it’s not
limited to that. It can be a Python or Ruby script, or a compiled binary file. The file extension
isn’t even needed. You can rename it to simply <code>itc</code> and it should run just fine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to run a file, you need to make it executable. This can be done with the <code>chmod</code> command
or via the GUI <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/35478/how-do-i-mark-a-file-as-executable-via-a-gui">using Nautilus’s <strong>Properties</strong> dialog</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="Path">
<h2>Path</h2>
<p>So we’ve created a program that shows a useless message, good job! However, every time we call
it, we need to specify the whole address to the file: <code>~/Desktop/itc</code> is probably not a very cool
looking command. In order to make it possible to simply run <code>itc</code>, you need to move it to the
<code>/usr/bin/</code> directory. This requires root permission so we’ll need <code>sudo</code> too:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo mv ~/Desktop/itc /usr/bin/itc
</code></pre>
<p>We can now run our program by simply typing <code>itc</code>. You guessed it: every executable file put in
this directory will be available as a command. There are other directories like this too. You can
see a whole list of such directories by typing <code>echo $PATH</code> to your terminal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make an executable file available as a command, shove it into a directory that’s included in
<strong>$PATH</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="Packages">
<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, most programs have a lot of files instead of one, and they are scattered to many
different folders. Let’s have a look at the files of <code>wget</code> - the downloader that’s included in
every major Linux distribution:</p>
<p><img alt="Wget files" src="wget-installed-files.png"></p>
<p>It’s not that the developers chose to annoy us by scattering them all over the place. It’s simply
complying to Linux structure: executable files go to <strong>/usr/bin</strong>, man pages (user manuals that
show up when you type <code>man wget</code>) go to <strong>/usr/share/man</strong>, and so on. For more complex programs,
the number of files alone is terrifying, which makes installing and remove the program a nightmare.</p>
<p>On another note, almost every Linux program depends on one or many other programs. This is
because of the UNIX philosophy that encourages writing each program to do one thing, and do it
well. The goal is to make each program easier to implement and maintain as well as to avoid
duplicate work. For example, program A may provide a functionality that both programs B and C
need. Otherwise, B and C developers both have to write code for one same functionality. In this
case, A is called a <strong>dependency</strong> of B and C. However, this introduces a bunch of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
We need to install A before installing B
</li>
<li>
We should know not to install A again when we install C
</li>
<li>
We must be careful not to remove A if we are still using B or C
</li>
<li>
What if B and C require different versions of A?
</li>
<li>
I can go on…
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where packages jump in. A package is basically the whole set of files of a program (or a
part of a program). It also stores necessary information such as which file goes to which
directory, what are the dependencies of this package, etc. A special program reads the
package, installs dependencies and puts files into their appropriate locations. This is called
a <strong>package manager</strong>. Of course besides installing, a package manager also manages updates
and removals of programs. Ubuntu is based on Debian, so it inherits Debian’s great package manager
called <strong>aptitude</strong> (or simply <code>apt</code>). Let’s take a look at wget’s dependencies:</p>
<p><img alt="Wget files" src="wget-dependencies.png"></p>
<p>The package manager maintains a list of available packages and their dependency/dependant
relationships. For Ubuntu, the list is updated regularly on Canonical’s official servers. Everytime
Ubuntu does the “Check for updates” thing, it is downloading the latest list of packages. And when
Ubuntu updates, it is simply pulling newer versions of the installed packages from Canonical’s
servers too. These servers are called <strong>repositories</strong>. All other major Linux distributions do the
same thing: letting the package manager and the repositories work on their thing, saving users
time to do more interesting stuff.</p>
<p>Here are some basic commands to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>sudo apt-get install package-name</code> to install package
</li>
<li>
<code>sudo apt-get remove package-name</code> - it’s obvious isn’t it?
</li>
<li>
<code>sudo apt-get update</code> - update package list. Note that it only updates the list, not the packages
</li>
<li>
<code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code> - upgrade packages to their latest versions
</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be programs that are not available on the official repositories, but are provided as
package files (Dropbox for example). Remember that the right package format for Ubuntu is <code>.deb</code>
files. Do not open <code>.rpm</code> files since they are for Fedora’s package manager called <code>yum</code>. When
you’ve obtained the file, simply open it with Ubuntu Software Center to start installing.</p>

<section id="Synaptic-Ubuntu-Software-Center">
<h2>Synaptic, Ubuntu Software Center</h2>
<p>Aptitude is only a command-line program, which is not very user-friendly. Synaptic is a GUI program
that provides a nice user interface that’s easy to use, while internally it uses <code>apt</code> to do all
the actual work.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="synaptic.png"></p>
<p>Ubuntu Software Center is more than a GUI wrapper for <code>apt</code>. It is something similar to Apple’s
appstore with all those program ratings and promotions. It’s nice for beginners but the fact that
it hides the details like dependency list makes it undesirable for intermediate users. If you are
comfortable with Synaptic, I strongly recommend using it as your main way to install/uninstall
stuff. But ultimately, using the command-line <code>apt</code> always is the fastest way.</p>
