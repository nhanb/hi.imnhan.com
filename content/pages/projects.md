I've written some open source software in my free time.
In some cases I even maintain them! Shocking, I know.

## McRoss

[McRoss](https://sr.ht/~nhanb/mcross) is a minimal and usable
[gemini://](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) browser written in python and
tkinter, meaning it Just Works (tm) on any self-respecting desktop OS: Linux,
Windows, Mac OS, and maybe the BSDs? Never tried one of those.


## ORTS

[ORTS](https://github.com/nhanb/orts/) is a GUI for operating scoreboards on
fighting game streams.


## An animated wallpaper for KDE Plasma

I was frustrated that KDE 5 didn't allow animated gifs as wallpaper so I [wrote
one][3]. Every now and then someone would [use it on /r/unixporn][4] and cause
a surge in github stars. It is currently my most starred repo, which gives me
mixed feelings.


## Caophim

[Caophim][5] is my take on imageboard software and also my excuse to try
[Nim][6]. There's a usable live instance at [caophim.net][7]. It's nowhere near
my goals but to be honest I got tired of [running][8] [into][9] [nim's][10]
[bugs][11], in the compiler, the standard library, the flagship module that's
supposed to supersede a module in the standard library... you name it. The
straw that broke the camel's back though, was [this gem right here][12] that
remains unfixed to this day.


## Unmaintained projects

[**Pytaku**][1] was an online "manga aggregator aggregator": it let me follow new
manga scanlation releases on multiple sites. Eventually the limits of Google
App Engine's free offering prompted me to do a rewrite which resulted in
endless yak-shaving and analysis paralysis. Then life happened, _then_
[tachiyomi][2] happened and I lost the actual need for the project.
