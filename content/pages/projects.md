I've written some open source software in my free time.
In some cases I even maintain them! Shocking, I know.


## Pytaku

[Pytaku][1] is a web-based manga reader that's designed to be as
self-host-friendly as possible. It's an experiment to see how far I can get
with a simpler toolset: basically just flask and sqlite (will most likely add
mithril js into the mix soon). Still figuring stuff out as I go.


## ORTS

[ORTS](https://github.com/nhanb/orts/) is a GUI for operating scoreboards on
fighting game streams.


## An animated wallpaper for KDE Plasma

I was frustrated that KDE 5 didn't allow animated gifs as wallpaper so I [wrote
one][3]. Every now and then someone would [use it on /r/unixporn][4] and cause
a surge in github stars. It is currently my most starred repo, which gives me
mixed feelings.


## McRoss

[McRoss](https://sr.ht/~nhanb/mcross) is a minimal and usable
[gemini://](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) browser written in python and
tkinter, meaning it Just Works (tm) on any self-respecting desktop OS.
Eventually Pytaku took most of my interest and time so it's shelved for now.


## Caophim

[Caophim][5] is my take on imageboard software and also my excuse to try
[Nim][6]. There's a usable live instance at [caophim.imnhan.com][7]. It's
nowhere near my goals but to be honest I got tired of [running][8] [into][9]
[nim's][10] [bugs][11], in the compiler, the standard library, the flagship
module that's supposed to supersede a module in the standard library... you
name it. The straw that broke the camel's back though, was [this gem right
here][12] that remains unfixed to this day.
