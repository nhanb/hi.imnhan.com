development and operations.

I usually go with the handle **nhanb** on most social networks; you can find links to my profiles

## About this blog

My mind is a sad mess that cannot hold much important/interesting information after a couple of
months or so. This blog is where I write down interesting things I discover, or practice expressing
myself by writing technical tutorials. On occasional bad days I might throw all my ramblings here
too, but hopefully those will be rare.

This blog uses [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) - a static site generator written in Python. The
static files are hosted on Github Pages. The theme used here is a (very slightly) modified fork
from [pelican-octopress-theme](https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme). All the
markdown content files can also be found on my [github repo](https://github.com/nhanb/blog).

I always appreciate feedback or further discussions on my posts, so feel free to point out if you
think I said something stupid. That's it. Enjoy reading!
