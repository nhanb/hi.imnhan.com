## About me

![My face](/images/nhan.jpg)

My name is **Bùi Thành Nhân**. I'm a Vietnamese web developer with a keen interest in DevOps.

When I'm not working, I tend to lurk around GitHub, go swimming, or try to [get decent at DDR][5].
I also recently got into [fighting games][7]. Give me a shout if you're in Hồ Chí Minh City and
would like some Street Fighter or Guilty Gear action! :)

## About this blog

My mind is a sad mess that cannot hold much important/interesting information after a couple of
months or so. This blog is where I write down interesting things I discover. On occasional bad days
I might throw all my ramblings here too, but hopefully those will be rare.

This blog uses [Pelican][1] - a static site generator written in Python. The static files are
hosted on Github Pages. All the markdown files can also be found on my [github repo][3]. The
Pelican theme I wrote for this blog can be found [here][2].

I always appreciate feedback or further discussion on my posts, so feel free to point out if you
think I said something stupid. That's it. Enjoy reading!

## Want to hire me?

I try to keep [my résumé][4] as concise and up-to-date (and pretty) as possible, but if you're into
full-blown CVs, [here it is][6].
