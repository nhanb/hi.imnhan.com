## About me

![My face](/images/nhan.jpg)

My name is **Bùi Thành Nhân**. I'm a software engineer with a strong focus on web backend
development and operations. Here's [my résumé][4] if anyone's interested.

I usually go with the handle **nhanb** on most social networks; you can find links to my profiles
on the sidebar.

## About this blog

My mind is a sad mess that cannot hold much important/interesting information after a couple of
months or so. This blog is where I write down interesting things I discover, or practice expressing
myself by writing technical tutorials. On occasional bad days I might throw all my ramblings here
too, but hopefully those will be rare.

This blog uses [Pelican][1] - a static site generator written in Python. The static files are
hosted on Github Pages. All the markdown files can also be found on my [github repo][3]. The
Pelican theme I wrote for this blog can be found [here][2].

I always appreciate feedback or further discussion on my posts, so feel free to point out if you
think I said something stupid. That's it. Enjoy reading!
