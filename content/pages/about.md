## About me

![My face](/static/images/nhan.jpg)

My name is **Bùi Thành Nhân**. I'm an undergraduate at RMIT Vietnam, focusing myself on web
delvelopment, mostly backend but I'm also taking huge interests in frontend frameworks (twitter
bootstrap, angularjs, etc.).

I have a working knowledge of Java desktop programming, experience on web programming with PHP and
setting up simple LAMP stacks. My current interests are python as a web backend language (django
anyone?) and tinkering with frontend frameworks.

I usually go with the handle **nhanb** on most social networks, you can find links to my profiles
on the sidebar. In my free time I enjoy tinkering with shell scripts (sometimes pythons scripts
too) to try out ways to improve productivity. When I'm not being a nerd, you can find me hitting
the gym (always going for the lighter dumbbells) or swimming.

## About this blog

My mind is a sad mess that cannot hold much important/interesting information after a couple of
months or so. This blog is where I write down interesting things I discover, or practice expressing
myself by writing technical tutorials. On occasional bad days I might throw all my ramblings here
too, but hopefully those will be rare.

This blog uses [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) - a static site generator written in Python. The
static files are hosted on Github Pages. The theme used here is a (very slightly) modified fork
from [pelican-octopress-theme](https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme). All the
markdown content files can also be found on my [github repo](https://github.com/nhanb/blog).

I always appreciate feedback or further discussions on my posts, so feel free to point out if you
think I said something stupid. That's it. Enjoy reading!
