So yesterday I went to a *networking event* - something I have never liked or been good at. I'm
not sure if I'm one of those introverts or if I'm just socially awkward, but the very idea of
going around trying to converse with total strangers just to exchange business cards is not at all
appealing to me. Anyway, that's another story. Right now I want to write about something a guy
from a non-tech company asked me:

> \- Have you built anything cool?  
> \- [pause] Well, more or less...  
> \- What do you mean by "more or less"? [...] Have you built anything at all?  

Then I went on trying to explain what my recent side project - 
[pytaku](https://pytaku.appspot.com) - does and why it is awesome for me. He seemed to be
disinterested halfway through so I decided to shut up anyway.

Sure, I have done stuff every now and then, be it assignment work or something I decided to create
for my own amusement. It is just funny how I have already stepped into to my final year without
taking a proper look back at what I have done in these past 2 years, so I'm going to do just that.

If you - Nicholas - are reading this and don't want all the nerdy stuff, here are my condensed
answers:

### Have you built anything?  
Yes, I have done desktop and Android games, a movie ticket sales program, a desktop manga
grabber, a web version of it that talks to dropbox, and several small shell scripts / web
utilities.  

### So, nothing cool?  
If you're neither a tech geek nor an otaku (which I assume you're probably not) then no,
there's probably nothing I've done that you would find interesting.

## First year - Welcome to the web, and the GUI programming disillusionment

I had touched *web stuff* before in high school: a vBulletin forum that I created (unofficially)
for students in my middle school. However, I only properly learned PHP and JS when I started the
Web Programming course here. With (moderately) great power came great desires, so I set out to
build a basic PHP site to scrape a view page's HTML to get direct video links (not working anymore
since a recent youtube update)

That was my first touch on jQueryUI and regular expressions; I also learned how RMIT's mekong
server sucked to the point that it didn't allow `get_file_contents()`.

I also learned about MVC and GUI programming with Java swing.
