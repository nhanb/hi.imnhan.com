**TL;DR:** bright crisp screen, acceptable keyboard, thin & light build, random
touchpad lag on both ChromeOS and Linux, almost usable on MrChromebox UEFI +
Arch Linux except for the fact that internal speakers crash most of the time
(wired headphones work fine though). It's absolutely not worth the sticker
price at [$1,099.99][1] (lol). Maybe consider buying if you can find it at a
heavy discount and the speakers issue has been fixed somehow.

## Context

Around 2022 I was looking for a replacement for my T530---something lighter
with a better screen---and saw a listing for a used Acer Chromebook Spin 713-3W
at only 10mil VND ($425, give or take). A recently released HiDPI laptop with
an i5-1135G7 at 425 freedom dollars? And I get to play with ChromeOS/Crostini
on a not-pathetically-weak x86 device? Sign me right up, I thought. The plan
was to run ChromeOS/Android apps for GUI stuff, and install my usual tmux+vim
based development [environment][2] on Crostini.

## The hardware

- Specs: i5-1135G7 (Tiger Lake), Xe graphics, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD
- Keyboard: acceptable
- Screen: 2256x1504 (3:2) at 13.5" (200dpi). Subjectively speaking, it's
  bright, colorful and delivers crisp text---I have nothing but praise here.
- Speakers: worse and quieter than my Samsung Tab S8 tablet

Here it is sandwiched between a Samsung Tab S8 and a Thinkpad T530:

As advertised, the laptop could run ChromeOS apps, Android apps, and Linux apps
via containers. By default I got a Debian container, but since I needed
up-to-date software for development, I set up an Arch container instead. [The
process][3] itself was straightforward enough.

Zoom for Android worked as expected, and to my surprise, Tailscale for Android
managed to wrangle traffic correctly for programs running inside Crostini too!
The only hiccup was that Magic DNS didn't work, so I needed to put the
hostname-IP pairs into /etc/hosts manually. I also had to change the temp dir
from /tmp to ~/tmp for [Go][4] tools to work, because Crostini programs weren't
allowed to exec files inside /tmp. Once I'd worked out those kinks, I could
open up a terminal and start working as if I were on one of my Arch PCs. Hell,
even docker/docker-compose Just Workedâ„¢ inside the container.

But then came the papercuts.

The touchpad would randomly lag, as in, dragging still
worked but there was a noticeable delay between my dragging and seeing the
cursor actually moving. The problem would just go away as randomly as it
happened.

Back when I used an actual Linux machine, I was used to having 10 virtual
desktops, numbered from 1 to 10, with Alt-n mapped to "jump to desktop #n", and
Windows-n mapped to "move window to desktop #n" (the `0` key maps to
desktop #10, naturally). While ChromeOS has a "workspaces" feature, there's no
way to navigate and juggle windows between them precisely and instantly.
_Instantly_ is an important keyword here: many tasks, while doable, suffered
from gratuitous animations and tedious step-by-step navigation. This reminded
me of when I tried to use a Macbook professionally: things kinda worked, but
the experience would always be intrinsically worse.

While Linux GUI programs were automagically put on the ChromeOS applications
list as first class citizens, certain quality-of-life features didn't work. For
example, on KDE I used to be able to drag a video streaming link from the
browser onto MPV's taskbar icon [to play it][5]. This no longer worked on
ChromeOS.

So I jumped ship.

## Real Arch Linux on MrChromebox UEFI

Installing _real_ Linux on this device requires installing the MrChromebox
custom UEFI firmware, which in turn requires disabling the firmware write
protection. Fortunately, for this device all I needed to do was opening up the
laptop and [disconnecting the battery][7]:

![battery-connector](/images/voxel_battery.jpg)

If you need more detailed instructions, here's the [official manual][8].

Then go [here][9] for instructions on how to download and run the MrChromebox
utility script. In my case, I also needed to enable developer mode to get
access to the chrosh shell.

After this I got a normal UEFI boot menu so I could pop in an Arch installer
USB drive and carried out the installation as usual.

I managed to install KDE plasma and everything worked except for audio: the
usual "default" audio profile wouldn't show up, even after I installed the
necessary packages: `sof-firmware` (sound firmware for recent Intel
generations) and `alsa-ucm-conf` (so-called topologies for these newer
devices). After some desperate googling I found
<https://github.com/eupnea-linux/audio-scripts> which installed some missing
configs lifted straight from ChromeOS upstream. Sure enough, the device showed
up:

![default-profile-get](/images/voxel_audio_device.png "")

And it would actually play sound... for a while until it crashes. I later found
out that wired headphones and HDMI audio work just fine, so only using internal
speakers is problematic.

I collected logs and tried googling but nothing comes up that matches my case.
Asking in the eupnea discord server yielded an uncertain response:

> looks like yet again intel broke something

Oh, and the random touchpad delay issue was still there, so I'm starting to
think the touchpad hardware itself is problematic.

And that's where I'm at. I'll probably gather more logs and submit an issue to
the SOF project. For now, consider this a warning: the laptop as of now is
probably not worth buying. Hell, in Vietnam you can get a second hand X1 Carbon
6th gen with an i7-8650U and 16GB of RAM for $460 right now from
<https://chotot.com>; that's a guaranteed best-in-class keyboard, decent
screen and Linux compatibility, at just a slight decrease in performance.

But hey, I would have never known any of this if I hadn't tried, right?

## Aside: Chromebook keyboard quirks on KDE

The most glaring issue is the absence of the `windows` key (aka `super`,
`hyper`, or `meta`). It's not a huge problem for me: I always make `capslock`
act as a `ctrl` key, so I can turn the original `ctrl` into `windows` instead:

![changed-modifier-keys](/images/voxel_keys_mod.jpg)

Another problem is that the F1-12 keys are not usable: they are [mapped to
function keys][10] in MrChromebox UEFI firmware, and there's no modifier to use
them as F-keys either. That means no F11 to toggle fullscreen, no Alt-F4, no F9
to toggle drop-down terminal, etc. Fortunately such global shortcuts can be
configured trivially from KDE's system preferences. On the other hand,
application-specific features that are hardwired to use F-keys are simply
unreachable: `htop` is one such example.
