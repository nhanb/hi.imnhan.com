<h1>Systemd-nspawn seems like a viable Vagrant alternative</h1>

<p>I’m working on a Python project where packaging container images is too
uneconomical compared to just pushing source code, so I went with the latter,
using an <a href="https://pyinfra.com/">ansible-like</a> configuration management system to
manage a <em>pet</em> server. That also means I need some way to replicate the pet
locally. Way back in my first job we used to utilize Vagrant for such a use
case, but if memory serves, it was painfully slow and would have minor breakages
all the time. To be honest it could have been either virtualbox or my
inexperienced fresh graduate self’s fault, but I’m sure of one thing:
initializing a Virtualbox-backed Vagrant VM is slooooow.</p>
<p>That leads us to… containers! Not the “application containers” category made
mainstream by Docker and friends, but the old-school “system containers” that
act like lightweight VMs: booting one will launch the full init system (read:
systemd) which then spawns the main application along with any supporting
services. Historically lxc/lxd (now <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/">incus</a>)
was the most notable in this space, but relatively recently systemd threw its
hat in the ring with systemd-nspawn. I’ve dabbled with incus for a while but
its configuration never clicked with me, and networking breaks if it’s run on
the same machine with Docker. Unfortunately I still need to touch Docker from
time to time, so that’s an major inconvenience. To be fair, this seems like
Docker’s fault for its overzealous iptables configs, and there are workarounds,
but I’m not comfortable with any of those. On the other hand, systemd-nspawn
just works, albeit with some manual network configuration.</p>

<p>The Arch Linux wiki page is pretty comprehensive, so I recommend just reading
that: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-nspawn">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-nspawn</a></p>
<p>However I don’t want to give the container full access to the host network, so
Host Networking is out. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-nspawn#Use_a_virtual_Ethernet_link">Private Networking using a virtual Ether
link</a>
is the next simplest option. This requires systemd-networkd on both host &amp;
guest. Also needs systemd-resolved on guest for DNS to Just Work, apparently:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># On host, enable systemd-networkd and create a debian bookworm root dir:
systemctl enable --now systemd-networkd
debootstrap \
    --include=dbus,libpam-systemd,systemd-resolved \
    bookworm \
    /var/lib/machines/myguest \
    'https://mirror.bizflycloud.vn/debian/'

# Set root password on guest:
systemd-nspawn -D /var/lib/machines/myguest passwd

# Now spawn a guest shell and enable necessary network services:
systemd-nspawn -D /var/lib/machines/myguest --network-veth -b
#&gt; systemctl enable --now systemd-networkd systemd-resolved
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, pyinfra doesn’t have a systemd-nspawn
<a href="https://docs.pyinfra.com/en/3.x/connectors.html">connector</a> yet, so I still
have to setup an SSH server on the guest. Maybe someday I’ll get sufficiently
motivated and write a pyinfra connector for it. Maybe.</p>

<p>Sounds like a You problem. Seriously though, just use WSL.</p>
