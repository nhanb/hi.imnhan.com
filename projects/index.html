<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>I’ve written some open source software in my free time.
In some cases I even maintain them! Shocking, I know.</p>
<section id="Shark">
<h2>Shark</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nhanb/shark/">Shark</a> is a simple “desktop pet”. It’s my first foray into cross-platform
desktop application development, also my first Go project that actually did
anything fun.</p>
</section>
<section id="Pytaku">
<h2>Pytaku</h2>
<p><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~nhanb/pytaku">Pytaku</a> is a web-based manga reader that’s designed to be as
self-host-friendly as possible. It’s an experiment to see how far I can get
with a simpler toolset: basically just flask, sqlite and mithril.js for the
frontend. There are still many rough spots but that’s enough for my daily use,
so it’s currently in maintenance mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="ORTS">
<h2>ORTS</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nhanb/orts/">ORTS</a> is a GUI for operating scoreboards on
fighting game streams. It’s served its purpose beaufifully during
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SaigonFGC/">our</a> local tournaments and several
<a href="https://sgc19.saigonfgc.com/en/">Saigon Cups</a>… until a certain pandemic
happened.</p>
</section>
<section id="An-animated-wallpaper-for-KDE-Plasma">
<h2>An animated wallpaper for KDE Plasma</h2>
<p>I was frustrated that KDE 5 didn’t allow animated gifs as wallpaper so I <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/com.nerdyweekly.animated">wrote
one</a>. Every now and then someone would <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/9sd5uy/kde_plasma_blur_gif_pixel_art_wallpaper_look/">use it on /r/unixporn</a> and cause
a surge in github stars. It is currently my most starred repo, which gives me
mixed feelings.</p>
</section>
<section id="McRoss">
<h2>McRoss</h2>
<p><a href="https://sr.ht/~nhanb/mcross">McRoss</a> is a minimal and usable
<a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">gemini://</a> browser written in python and
tkinter, meaning it Just Works (tm) on any self-respecting desktop OS.
Fast forward a couple of years and there’s still no interesting content on the
gemini-verse (that I can find anyway). Also given the fact that there’s a very
good <a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/mozz.us/">web proxy</a> now, McRoss is pretty
much shelved.</p>
</section>
<section id="Caophim">
<h2>Caophim</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nhanb/caophim">Caophim</a> is my take on imageboard software and also my excuse to try
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>. There’s a usable live instance at <a href="https://caophim.imnhan.com/">caophim.imnhan.com</a>. It’s
nowhere near my goals but to be honest I got tired of <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/13531">running</a> <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/13986">into</a>
<a href="https://github.com/pragmagic/karax/issues/143">nim’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/pragmagic/karax/issues/142">bugs</a>, in the compiler, the standard library, the flagship
module that’s supposed to supersede a module in the standard library… you
name it. The straw that broke the camel’s back though, was <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/13923">this gem right
here</a> that remains unfixed to this day.</p>
